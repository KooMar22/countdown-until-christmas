My take on the Christmas Counter App.

The App counts the time until Christtmas. When Christmas period is here, it displays the greeting card. When it passes, it starts counting again.

It uses JS React. To run this:
1. download the whole content from Github
2. install it - "npm i"
3. Run it - "npm run dev"
